# Hello!
This project is called the ProjectSeaWeb and currently is the third iteration of me trying to create a website! But this one is the newest and the one that I will keep updating~!

I'm mainly a digital artist. I draw original characters, but I also created this website using ReactJS!
Seavalanche is a brand name of mine, but also a character name of mine. But you can call me Vesnea~!

This website is mostly to layout the things I wanted to show but can't on regular social medias because of either I'd need to compete with the algorithm or the lack of customization and organization.
But as you can see, the website will undergo many updates until it reaches the final state. And also, the layout was designed by me so it looks a bit different than any other website layout.

I hope you have fun time looking through my website~!
