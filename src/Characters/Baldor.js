Don't mess with him because even as huge and heavy as he is, he still can move quite fast with his two pillar-like arms beside him. He is very determined to outlast everything, even if hundreds of attackers fight him alone. With his root rocks, he also can't be toppled over by anyone except intentionally by himself.",
