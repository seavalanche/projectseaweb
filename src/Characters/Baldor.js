Don't mess with him because even as huge and heavy as he is, he still can move quite fast with his two pillar-like arms beside him. He is very determined to outlast everything, even if hundreds of attackers fight him alone. With his root rocks, he also can't be toppled over by anyone except intentionally by himself.",

    bodyShapeDescription: {
        en: `A huge rock creature shaped like a big wall. Two round eyes visible on top of the 5 meters body, it's as wide as 3 meters and as thick as 2 meters. There are two burly hands on the side of the wall, some vertical reinforcements as the makeshift legs on both left and right side, and roots below him for added support. The roots consists of rocks tied with tree roots.
        
        The body is a giant rock composed of a combination of basalt exterior with granite reinforcements, while the interior is composed of sandstone. Basalt is extremely tough and dense, likewise with granite which is also resistant to erosion. Sandstone inner structure provides unyielding defense from impacts.`,
