            "Stellar Inferno: Zumiko summons the power of the stars, igniting a blazing inferno that scorches everything in its path. Flames dance and swirl with celestial energy, incinerating foes and leaving devastation in their wake. Those caught within the Stellar Inferno are consumed by searing heat, their flesh burnt to cinders by the intensity of Zumiko's flames. Even objects in the vicinity are reduced to ash, swept away by the unstoppable force of the inferno.",
            "Infernal Passion: Zumiko's fiery desire blazes like an inferno, infusing his and his allies with unstoppable passion. Fueled by the flames of his ambition, he inspires those around him to pursue their goals with relentless fervor and determination. This move not only ignites the spirits of allies but also instills fear and uncertainty in enemies, as they face the overwhelming force of Zumiko's burning passion for victory.",
            "Levitation: Celestial energy grants Zumiko the ability of levitation.",
            "Vacuum Flare: Zumiko leaps through space, his left forepaw blazing with an ethereal flame. The trail left behind resembles a rift in the cosmos, revealing a star-filled night sky. The effects of this flame depend on the target: those with pure hearts remain unharmed, their resolve strengthened to pursue their dreams. Those with ill intent, however, are scorched by its searing heat, forced to relive their most painful memories as the fire consumes them."
