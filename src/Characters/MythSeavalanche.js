        At some point in her stay, she decided to split her energies into five and let them explore in her stead, which then she realized it will result in her fainting and fell unconscious for an undetermined time. Fate says she will wake up when her fragments needed her the most.`,

        She wore a golden elongated oval ring chain necklace that has a gold stylized S-shaped pendant (also symbolized infinity) with a small heart attachment below it, matching her golden halo-like aether power concentrated on her back.

        She also wore an almost transparent pink piece of silk tulle fabric shaped like a bowtie with a trailing fabric on her left upper-arm. Under her left ear, she wore a pink earring that doesn't puncture her ear at all using a heart-shaped clamp and it features a pink tassle at the end of it. Her hands are four digits paws, while her feet are three digits paws, both have paw pads on it.`,
