        en: "Rakariki is a lean white-furred cat body adorned with yellow lightning stripes. He is a fearless cat due to his long winning streaks in his battles. That claim is proven by his lightning speed and his powerful lightning attack when it's raining. He has lightning-shaped fur on the tip of the ears and even the tail itself. He has a light blue collar on his neck and a yellow circle-shaped pendant as a physical proof of his courage.",
