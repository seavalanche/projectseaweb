        en: "He is a black wolf with some extra fluff that looks spiky despite it being very soft.  As the youngest member of the team, he usually carries most of the team's stuffs using straps and bags on his body and it actually hindered his usually nimble movements. He will listen to Tharos most of the times, unless he noticed something he is interested in as he will go and figure things out by himself in excitement. But despite this, the team will be deeply saddened if he is missing.",
