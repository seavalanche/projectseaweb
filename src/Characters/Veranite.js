The fur is as dark as the void itself, but his eyes are bright yellow as bright as a star in the middle of a dark, empty space. Veranite has three tails instead of one, and those tails make it seems like he has a cloak covering his back in a battle. In a dark environment, with all of his glow spots glowing, Veranite might look like a galaxy in the sky.",
