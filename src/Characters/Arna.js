        en: "Arna is a white bunny with a pair of very long ears, usually accompanied by three Mini Arnas. She is a very skilled healer, while the Mini Arnas are very skilled fighters. Arna can also fight, probably fight better than even Mini Arna. But due to her kind behavior, she usually avoids fights and just heals the Mini Arnas throughout a fight to the point of exhaustions. Her ears are a very useful asset in a fight: it can be used to heal, shield, or even damage opponents.",
