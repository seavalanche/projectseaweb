                    <p>
                        I am a self-taught digital artist who has a big interest in cute stuff. I  started around 2015 with nothing but a pencil, paper, and a computer  mouse. I scanned the sketch and then tried to trace the lines I had  drawn on Photoshop using just the mouse—vector lines were a life-saver!

                        The artworks I mostly create are watercolor-esque. I like to blend  colors to create smooth transitions of shading. Digital media made it  easier with layers, transform, and especially undo-s! But don’t let it  fool you, because I also create some art without digital media, hehe~

                        My inspirations come from soft and cute creations by other artists. I  also appreciate cool and snappy creations. Varied expressions of  characters, nice and neat clothing, atmospheric backgrounds, and many  more are what inspire me to keep creating!
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently, I’m aiming to expand my own original creations—with  Seavalanche and the bunch—including the world, which can also be  expanded through Seavalanche’s lore story writing. Furthermore, the  creation of this website is also a part of it!</p>
                    <p>I have a small Discord server where a bunch of artists and non-artists  have gathered to talk about stuff—including arts! It’s a place where I  frequently share updates about my life and also my art processes and  thoughts. The members frequently share their favorite arts from other  artists too—we have a special album channel where we can see various  artworks as inspirations!</p>
                    <p>Fans can support me and commission me via Ko-fi. It’s also a place where  I will put out some special items—such as calendars—and hopefully  physical merch in the future! Any support helps me monetarily and  emotionally to keep going with my hobby—which I hope can help brighten  any people and fans that see it~</p>
