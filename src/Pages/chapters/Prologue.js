            <p>There was an unknown entity — pure, bright, powerful, intelligent, and kind. The world was incredibly peaceful, until it disappeared. No one knows what happened. Its existence was very short. It was unfortunate...</p>
            <p>After a considerable amount of time—its exact duration remaining a mystery—a creature bearing a resemblance to the unknown entity was discovered. This creature aided the residents and environment through its potent aura, exuding determination and strength. Its power was unparalleled, dissuading any potential adversaries from approaching its vicinity. The populace bestowed upon it the name “Seava”.</p>
            <p>Legend has it that Seava's unwavering determination and strength enabled the locals to survive numerous unknown enemies that wanted to take the world down. After countless battles, they realized that the locals they had helped were only the beginning, as they uncovered the actual plot of the enemy commander.</p>
