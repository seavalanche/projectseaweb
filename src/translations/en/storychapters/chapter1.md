# Chapter 1: Protection

The time was peaceful: a gentle breeze, warm sunshine, the aroma of flowers, and the soothing sound of the river. A creature resembling a fox awoke in the middle of a forest. At first, the fox just sat there, appearing confused. But then, it thought to itself,

"Huh? Where am I? I feel like I've been sleeping for a long time, but where is this place?"

The river appeared to be nearby. The fox then rose onto all fours, attempting to move. And it seemed like the fox was attempting to reach the river.

”This forest... seems familiar, but I can't remember anything. It seems like I don't even remember who I am."

The fox then inspected itself, "I look like a blue fox. Hmmmm... I don't remember ever seeing one like myself.”

The fox then walked alongside the river for a long time. Fortunately, it was morning, so it could see the way clearly. After what felt like a few hours, the fox finally reached a small village. Houses were made out of hay, with tall grass surrounding the village. Flowers were scattered here and there, but there was nothing else to catch the eye. The fox then came close to one of the straw bale houses.

"Excuse me? May I ask where this place is? I am somewhat lost here."

No one answered.

"Huh? I guess there are four houses to go. There must be at least one person here."

The fox then went to all the houses and found no one. Inside the houses were full of items, albeit in bad condition. There seemed to be no food to be found though.

"Ugh, I think I need to find a way to get food and stay for the night."

The fox did get fish from the river and then stayed inside one of the houses. Then something happened in the middle of the night. Loud wolf sounds were heard nearby while the fox was still lying down on a makeshift hay bed, gazing out of the door at the sky.

"Huh! I think I'm in trouble if they find out I stayed inside their house without permission."

The fox then ran outside and got away as far as possible, while still wanting to try and observe the commotion from a distance.

One of the wolves stopped in his tracks and said, "Someone was here just a few seconds ago."

The fox then exclaimed internally, "OH NO!"

"I need to move back slowly," it thought.

The wolves then began sniffing the air, attempting to pinpoint the fox's location. One of the wolves then said something to the first wolf who had exclaimed about the intruder's presence.

"Diego, I think it's just a stray fox running past our houses here, nothing to worry about," the wolf said.

"No, this one seems unfamiliar. I've never smelled this scent before. It seems to be different from that of a normal fox," Diego said to the wolf named Berth.

"I think Diego is right. This scent is unique. Perhaps if we follow it, we might actually discover treasures!" Another wolf named Alex exclaimed.

"Nonsense! We have crossed so many mountains, yet we have never found a single treasure that the folklore has mentioned!" A giant bird named Oliver retorted.

"I suggest we cease this argument and begin searching for the intruder," Diego proposed.

The four of them then began tracking the fox's scent. The fox, meanwhile, continued attempting to move away discreetly from the area. Without anything nearby to muffle the sound of its footsteps, the task seemed challenging to accomplish.

The bird Oliver took to the air, surveying the surroundings from above. The forest still provided the fox with some cover from an aerial scan. But the fox's unease seemed to heighten at the presence of a bird in the group.

"Oh, what? There's a bird? Oh no," the fox internally exclaimed.

The panic didn't aid matters, and the fox eventually stumbled over tree roots, resulting in a significant noise.

"Aha! There it is!" Alex exclaimed.

"Oh! OH! SHOOT!" The fox then bolted into a run.

The panicked sprint only made it easier for Oliver to spot the fox's location and swoop down to intercept it. The wolves, now fueled by the visual pursuit, also dashed forward, no longer dependent solely on their sense of smell.

"Who are you? What do you want?" Diego shouted.

The fox's sole focus remained on its flight, the surge of adrenaline leaving no room for other thoughts.

"I suppose we just need to catch it, correct?" Berth asked, uncertainty in her voice.

Closing in step by step, their pursuit grew relentless. Oliver's aerial tactics further disrupted the fox's concentration.

"Oh no, oh no, oh no. I simply woke up in this forest, why am I being chased?!" the fox thought in a state of panic.

A river lay not far from the fox. A crazy idea began to form in its head.

"I need to jump onto it, the river seems to have a strong flow," the fox thought.

With the river now visible, the fox readied itself and then took the leap onto it. Oliver narrowly missed the target.

"Ah! I missed," Oliver exclaimed.

A rush of cold water served as a stark reminder to the fox that adrenaline was crucial for its survival.

"So it jumped. Try to follow along the river!" Diego commanded.

The vigorous current caused the fox to dip into the water repeatedly, its lungs aching for air. Yet, the fox's determination to evade the pursuit overpowered the pain. However, a daunting sight soon met its eyes: the river led to a waterfall.

"Ah, dang! Why does it have to be this difficult! Can I even survive this?" The fox screamed internally.

"Wait, it will die if it goes over the waterfall!" Oliver stated with concern.

"Can you reach it before it gets plummeted to its death!?" Berth urgently inquired.

"Don't risk your life for an intruder; just keep an eye on it!" Diego reminded.

The fox realized that the wolves had surrounded it from all angles, even the sky. All eyes were now fixed on the river's edge. Heavy mists shrouded the other side of the waterfall, obscuring the severity of the impending fall. The situation was so dire that the fox concluded being saved by them would be better than plummeting into the waterfall.

"Help! Can someone help me!?" The fox shouted amidst the dips.

"Huh? It asked for help. I don't even know if I can swoop in to help it," Oliver expressed in doubt.

"No, like I said, it's just an intruder, don't risk your life," Diego reminded.

"But it will die if we let it fall!" Berth retorted.

"I'll try to lower down myself and try to catch it," Oliver stated.

The bird indeed attempted to catch the fox, and the fox in turn tried to reach Oliver's foot. However, time was not on their side, as the waterfall's edge drew dangerously close. The fox's attempt to reach Oliver's foot fell short, and it crashed down with the waterfall. The wolves and the bird remained at the top, stunned.

"Noooooooo!" Oliver shouted.

The world turned dark for the fox, yet it miraculously survived the fall. While unconscious, it emitted a faint glow mid-fall. What occurred afterward remains a mystery to all...

---

"Hey? Are you awake now?" An elderly voice reached the fox's ears.

"Ugh. Where am I?" The fox replied. It found itself lying on a makeshift hay bed with a hay blanket over it.

"Good morning, and welcome to Hope Swamp. I'm Christy, the medic head in this village," A Crocodile medic named Christy responded. "I discovered you unconscious near the waterfall as I was collecting fresh water yesterday. Surprisingly, you didn't seem to sustain any injuries," Christy said while tending to her medicines.

"I was being chased by three wolves and a bird yesterday. The panic-stricken situation led me to jump into the river, unaware that it would lead to a waterfall at the end," the fox explained.

"Three wolves and a bird? Isn't that the infamous treasure hunter Team Emblem? I didn't know they would harm anyone. I believed they were merely treasure hunters," the medic replied.

"I believe there was a misunderstanding. I had borrowed a bed in one of their houses for the night, assuming the houses were abandoned," the fox reasoned.

"Well, at least now you are safe. But I must inquire, where do you come from? I've never encountered a species like yours before," Christy asked.

"Uhh, that. I was also wondering about that myself since I woke up in the middle of that forest without any memories," the fox answered.

Christy paused her work on the medicines and gazed into the fox's eyes for a prolonged moment. The awkward silence persisted before eventually subsiding.

"You know, there is a myth around this area that speaks of a creature similar in color and species to you, a fox. The myth suggests that this creature emerged and saved the world in the past. Although we don't seem to need one right now, everything appears to be in order," Christy mused.

The fox then remained silent, envisioning a creature powerful enough to safeguard the world. Its train of thought was interrupted by the medic's words.

"Pardon me, but I've never asked for your name."

"Uh, I actually don't remember."

Christy paused for a moment, hand on her chin. "The fox in the myth has the name Seava in it. We still don't know the full name, though. And you somewhat remind me of Seava.... What if you adopt the name Seava too?" Christy pondered.

That question actually halted the fox's train of thought. The idea of using the name Seava felt so natural, so fitting. It was as if it had been destined to be named Seava from the very beginning.

"I like it. I think I'll use it."

"Mhm, it does fit you. I suppose I'll refer to you as Seava for now."

"Thank you."

Christy paused to consider, then inquired, "I have another question. Are you, um, a boy or a girl? Sorry for the unusual question, but since I've never encountered a species like you, I can't make a guess."

"Uhh, what's a boy, what's a girl?" Seava looked perplexed.

"Never mind. I'll take you outside and introduce you to the village leader instead."

They stepped outside and met the crocodile leader, Billy. He appeared quite old and frail. His prime days might have been in the past, yet his eyes gleamed with wisdom.

"Good morning, Leader Billy. I have Seava here, the fox I found unconscious yesterday. They seem to be in good condition," Christy initiated the conversation.

"Good morning, Christy. So you're Seava, huh? Isn't that the name of the divine entity from the myth?"

"Seava here has lost their memories. So we have to come up with a name. And I believe the name suits them well, given their unique coloring and how it matches their species, which is a fox."

"Quite interesting," the leader remarked. He then turned his gaze to Seava and inquired, "What do you plan to do today, then?"

"I wanted to know where am I. Not just in the village name, but as in a whole. Where is this place in the world? I can't remember anything aside from waking up and then being chased by wolves."

"Ah, this world is what you called Stelluc. There are 7 continents in this world. And you are in the forest biome of the continent Sprav right now.”
