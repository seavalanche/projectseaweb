# Creative Freedom  
> 11 July 2025

Round circle, symmetrical shape  
Solid color, satisfying result  
Creations, no matter the shape  
If it's coming from the heart, it's always valid  

Clouds above the sky  
Soft but can't be touched  
Imaginations doesn't need to be grand  
It just needed to be enjoyed  

# Unique Touch  
> 12 July 2025

Knowing everything to the detail  
It creates whatever based on the data  
A slight touch of dark spot  
Even if unintended is still yours  

A machine churns on any data it learned  
It doesn't even know what is the sky  
Yours in comparison might be wobbly  
But the wobble you created is uniquely yours  

# Comparing Joy  
> 12 July 2025

Bright sky happy tears  
Pink and blue ice cream joy  
You feel so much tears  
Thinking others having joy  

It feels that everyone is out of reach  
They have everything you dreamed of  
Giving yourself some grace  
By not comparing yourself to others  

# My Own Dream  
> 12 July 2025

My own island looks messy  
Random things scattered around  
They seemed to do it better  
Shapes and sizes all were precise  

Perfection feels amazing  
Especially if you can copy it  
But is it your own dream now?  
Or do you recreate the dreams of others?
